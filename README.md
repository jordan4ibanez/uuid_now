# uuid_now
I want a UUID int64 and I want it now!

Extremely simple. If you have one of these in your program, you'll never have overlapping UUIDS.

You will receive a ``c_int64_t`` value when ``new_uuid()`` is called.

There is also a concurrent version that needs to be created. (mutex creation)

This project is literally only aimed at game engine development.
